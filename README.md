## Final Q2

###Vertical Pendulum

        *From a given equation of the Vertical Pendulum, dimensionless form was derived.
        *The analysis of the equation proposes that the vertical up position is stable for large enough angular velocity and amplitude.
        *By fixing the amplitude and testing various oscillation, we hope to be able to see and model the behavior.

       1)As the angular velocity gets larger and larger, a stable oscillation around Ï€ can be seen.

        2) However for angular velocity lower than 145 R/s, the oscillation is no longer around a constant value.
